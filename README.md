# FreeCodeCamp Certification Projects

Welcome! This repo is where I keep all my projects from FreeCodeCamp's certification challenges.

## About

Here you'll find the projects I built while following the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, especially from the Responsive Web Design course. I used these projects to practice HTML, CSS, and get the hang of building pages from scratch.

## Projects

- [SurveyForm](./SurveyForm/index.html)
- [Tribute Page HTML](./Tribute%20Page/index.html)
- [Tribute Page CSS](./Tribute%20Page/styles.css) 

*(I'll update this list as I finish more projects.)*

**Some projects are made in Portuguese/Japanese to make learning easier.
All projects follow the requirements proposed by FreeCodeCamp.**
