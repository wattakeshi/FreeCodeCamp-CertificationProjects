          <p>This powerlifting training program is focused on developing strength in the three main lifts: Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift. It's designed to help athletes of all levels progress consistently and safely, using the principles of periodization and load progression.</p>
          <p>
            The program is built on the philosophy of linear progression, which is a key component for continuous growth.

          <p>The program is divided into three training phases, each with a specific objective:</p>
          <p><span></span></p>
          <p><code>Hypertrophy Phase:</code> Focuses on increasing muscle mass and volume base.</p>
          <p><code>Strength Phase:</code> Focuses on increasing maximum strength, with less volume and more intensity.</p>
          <p><code>Peaking Phase:</code> Focuses on reducing volume and maintaining intensity, so the athlete is in the best possible condition for a competition.</p>
          <p>
            These phases are crucial for building a solid foundation and reaching peak performance.
